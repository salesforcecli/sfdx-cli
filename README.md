This ~~is~~ was the latest `sfdx` CLI application, based on the
[oclif](https://oclif.io) CLI engine. By default it comes installed with various plugins.

## Releases

We publish the `latest` CLI on Thursdays. At the same time we also publish the `latest-rc` release candidate CLI. The release candidates contain changes that will likely be in the final official version for the next release.
To Install the `latest-rc` version, run `npm install sfdx-cli@latest-rc`. We suggest having your CI/CD pipeline use the `latest-rc` in addition to the `latest` release tags.

Run `sfdx version` to display the version of Salesforce CLI installed on your computer. Run `sfdx plugins --core` to display the versions of the installed plug-ins.

Run `sfdx update` to update the CLI to the latest available version.

## Installation

You can install this by either using an OS-specific installer [available here](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli), by directly installing it with `npm` or `yarn` (see the instructions below).

### Installing with `npm` or `yarn`

To get started, you'll need to install `node` v12 or greater, though we recommend using the latest v14 (LTS) for the best experience. While this can be done using an installer from [nodejs.com](nodejs.com) or via an OS-specific package manager, we recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to easily manage multiple `node` versions.

If using `nvm`, be sure that you've selected the appropriate version with something like `nvm use v14.x.y`, where `x` and `y` are specific to the version that you installed. If you want to use this version by default run `nvm alias default node` -- otherwise, when you restart your shell `nvm` will revert to whatever version configured prior to installing the latest.

### `npm`

`npm` is installed automatically with Node.js. Install the CLI using `npm` as follows:

```bash
> npm install --global sfdx-cli
```

### `yarn`

`yarn` is another popular Node.js package manager that can be used to install the CLI, but it needs to be [installed separately](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) from Node.js if you choose to use it.

Note that by default `yarn` will attempt to install the binary in a location that may conflict with the location used by the installers, so you may additionally want to run the following command to avoid collision should you want to maintain two separate installations: `yarn config set prefix ~/.yarn` (macOS and Linux). Then, use the following:

```bash
> yarn global add sfdx-cli
```

### Docker Images

We provide versioned images on dockerhub. They come in 2 flavors

1. `slim` is just the CLI installed using the installer for linux and openjdk11
2. `full` includes other utilities and a full node/npm installation

Interactive Example

```bash
# choose a tag to pull and run
docker pull salesforce/salesforcedx:latest-rc-slim
docker run -it salesforce/salesforcedx:latest-rc-slim

# then run any sfdx command you like
sfdx version

# when done, type exit to leave the container
exit

```

Remote Execution Example

```bash
# using the ID of a running container, execute some command like "sfdx version"
docker exec -it 8b1e2696a243 bin/bash sfdx version



```
